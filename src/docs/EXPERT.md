# Expert routines #
This is a complete list of our currently supported _Expert_ routines sorted according to the types of problems they are associated with and their precision. Currently the two supported precisions in __eiscor__ are double precision (__D__) and complex double precision (__Z__).

## Unitary eigensolvers ##
Eigensolvers for unitary matrices can be interacted with at different levels in __eiscor__. At the highest level there
