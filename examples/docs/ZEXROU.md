# ZEXROU #
_Zomplex EXample Roots Of Unity_

In this example the roots of unity are compute by solving the eigenvalue problem for a corresponding permuation matrix. This example solves it two ways:
 1. Form the permutation matrix explicitly and then call [__ZUHFQR__]().
 2. Form the permutation matrix implicitly in factored form and then call [__ZUFFQR__]().

The eigenvalues are known exactly and this example checks the computed results for accuracy.
